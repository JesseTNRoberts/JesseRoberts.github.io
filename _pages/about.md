My name is Jesse. I am an assistant professor at Tennessee Tech University where I research artificial intelligence, language models, and robotics. 

I am currently **accepting applications** for master's and Phd student positions. If you are a curious person with an interest in solving real problems and exploring untrodden paths through AI then feel free to reach out via email! 

This website

Here you'll find papers and information about current happenings. More interestingly, I tend to keep an ongoing research journal. Fully formed ideas become papers. The research journal is not that. It's where the ideas take form. Morover, it's where I answer my own questions.
