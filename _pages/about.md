My name is Jesse (Vanderbilt PhD '24). I am an inately curious assistant professor at Tennessee Tech University where I research artificial intelligence, language models, and robotics. 

Specifically, my research focuses on the theoretical limitations of language models and empirically evaluating their behavior in light of human cognition with applications to human-robot interaction and language preservation. But I'm also interested in game theory and any idea that can **positively impact people**. 

I am currently **accepting applications** for master's and Phd students. If you are a curious person with an interest in solving real problems and exploring untrodden paths through AI then feel free to reach out via email!


This website
------
Here you'll find papers, work in progress, and whatever I'm up to (usually running/climbing, reading, and research). 

I tend to keep an ongoing research journal. Fully formed ideas become papers. The research journal is not that. It's where the ideas take form. Morover, it's where I answer my own questions.
