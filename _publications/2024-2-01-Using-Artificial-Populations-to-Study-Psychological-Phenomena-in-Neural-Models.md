collection: publications
permalink: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29856
excerpt: 'We leverage work in uncertainty estimation in a novel approach to efficiently construct experimental populations. The resultant tool, PopulationLM, has been made open source. We provide theoretical grounding in the uncertainty estimation literature and motivation from current cognitive work regarding language models.'
