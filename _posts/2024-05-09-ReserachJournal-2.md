New researchers often struggle with developing independent research. Some advisors prefer to let students wonder and thereby learn to succeed (painful) and others prefer to guide (creates dependency). I have no answers for this philosophical question. However, I do have advice for young researchers gathered along my own journey. 

I acquired these pieces of advice from wonderful researchers who have shaped my philosophy of research.

## Claims first, then the experiments. - Pat Langley
Researchers often tilt at windmills. They will perform hundreds of experiments and gather tremendous data with no particular purpose. This is not science.  

Start with the claims that you wish to make (this is your hypothesis). Then, devise a set of experiments that, if they go as you anticipate, will support the claims. This is the scientific method. 

## Make your claims early in the paper. Repeat them as they are addressed. Summarize them in the end. - Pat Langley
The point of a paper needs to be unmistakable. Often, a paper's contributions will not be explicitly stated. Scientific writing is a form of rhetoric. To get a point across, you need to be consistent and careful in the claims you make so that others can understand how to learn from and build onto it.

## Write papers by making figures first. They should tell the story. - Maithilee Kunda
STEM research can be very technical and dense. Frankly, it's not terribly likely that even other researchers will read your work thoroughly unless the paper is of tremendous import. So, make the narrative easy to follow and tell the story in pictures. 

## Anything worth doing is worth doing badly. - Pat Langley
This quote is not originally from Pat. But Pat repurposed it. His point was, done is better than perfect. This is tremendously important when performing research on a deadline. Get it done.
