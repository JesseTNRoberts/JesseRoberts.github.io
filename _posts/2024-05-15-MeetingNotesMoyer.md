From the Program Director, it seems we need to ensure that we connect with a pressing need in the DEB portion of biology. Probably the ES side. On the computer science of the proposal, it needs to be clear how the virtuous cycle will play out. Specificaly, how will the data  force us to innovate in cs?

## How does satellite data force innovation in foundation models?

Satellite data is taken on the scale of days. By merging that data with other GIS data, we should be able to presict next pass. However, we should also be able to predict next season as well. However, it is not advantageous to necessarily generate every frame to arrive at the nexy season. Rather, it is desirable to presict multiple time scales simultaneously. Near term predictions will be largely dependent on weather while longer term will be dependent on climate. So, the mode will have to learn represntations that are appropriate for near and far term prwsictions simultaneously. This is interesting and innovative from a foundation model perspective and is necessary to inderstand and predict animal movement.
