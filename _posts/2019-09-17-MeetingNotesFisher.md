- Discussed the direction of research - Decided that the best place to start would be the Computational Critic
- For the submission deadline of ICCC develop proof of concept and write paper
- Was discussed that this is a good area as there has not been much done in this area and there are many low hanging fruits available

### Follow up items for next meeting
- Look into technologies that could be leveraged to cobble together an Auto-Critic (topic modeling, summarization systems, etc.)
