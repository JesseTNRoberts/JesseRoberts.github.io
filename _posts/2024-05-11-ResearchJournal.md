Is discourse or rhetoric language transcendant? That is, does rhetoric require language and therefore is dependent on and shaped by it? 

## Is rhetoric inately encoded in language or is language simply used to express it? 

In some fields it seems a forgone conclusion that rhetoric can be faithfully translated to another language. This presupposes that the rhetoric is not dependent upon the language. If this is the case, then are there some rhetorical notions that cannot be translated between some languages? If all rhetorical notions can be translated between all languages, what is the representation of rhetoric beyond language? 

An interesting related point is the fact that there are no words for the idea that physicists had about the nature of particles. This lead to a folk misunderstanding of particle-wave dualism. The meaning was, if things with particle-like momentum have wave-like interference then things understood as waves may have momentum. The resultant discovery was that **each was actually** an expression of a **particle** but that **particles were more complicated** than originally understood. However, this idea is not well translated into language and the folk understanding is often that light can be a particle **or** a wave.
