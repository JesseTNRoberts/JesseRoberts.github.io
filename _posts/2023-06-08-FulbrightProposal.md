These are the notes I took for my first Fulbright application. It was not successful. I applied for Fall 24 in Ireland as phd student expecting to graduate by the end of summer 24. However, I didnt't hear about the opportunity until the deadline was only a month away. I was able to get a letter of invitation from the host school.

## Application Notes


The goal is to assess the applicability of existing computational linguistic tools to language preservation and to identify strategic extensions.

What work has been done addressing language preservation from a computational linguistic standpoint?

How do we develop a dataset that is appropriate? How do we evaluate a linguistic corpora for appropriateness?

Corpora need to be parallel to facilitate translation (assuming this is a goal). Language preservation often starts with developing such a corpus.



How should a conversational system be different if learners are engaging with it for the purpose of practicing and learning the language?






One known deficiency of language models that makes them ill-suited to language preservation is the tremendous amount digitized written text they require for training, something that many endangered languages do not have. It seems that the data efficiency of these models is related to their ability to reason about language at a discourse level. I propose to develop the first neural rhetorical structure tree generator for the Irish language and evaluate 

Rhetorical structure recognition, idiom recognition and translation
RST generation
Theoretical analysis of data efficiency
Empirical analysis of rhetorical structure inference





Ireland is the best fit for this project because, as a country, they have been actively preserving the Irish language for several decades. Therefore, the Irish people have deep insight into this experience, its difficulties, and the things which remain as challenges to the status of the language. Further, Ireland possesses an indigenous language which, though considered low-resource and endangered, has had some successful language modeling work completed already. In short, Ireland is the best fit country for the project because the Irish language is the best fit language due to the work done there to preserve it.

I have prepared for this project by studying and focusing my dissertation on the theory and behavior of modern language models. Further, I have conducted a preliminary review of relevant literature to ensure that this work is novel, needful, and feasible. Beyond the academics of the project in general, I have prepared to conduct this project in Ireland by studying the Irish language. I hope this passion for the Irish language and culture will make me well suited to maintaining and improving the Irish sentiment towards the United States. 

Finally, I spent a week in Ireland in 2022 with my time divided between Kinsale, Galway, Dublin, and Blarney. This tour of the country included cultural experiences like visiting the cliffs of Moher, seeing the Book of Kells and touring Trinity College, and being in Galway for the horse races. However, it also included more personal interactions like a trip to store with the owner of our rental while he detailed the current political events in Ireland and asked our views on current events in the United States. I believe the trip and preliminary interactions with the host institution have prepared me to conduct this project in Ireland.









My career has been somewhat atypical in comparison to most academics. Growing up, my family was below the poverty line. My first goal after college was to become financially secure. So, I spent 8 years working in industry as an engineer. I had success and was offered a position as the director of controls, a great personal honor. However, I decided instead to attend Vanderbilt to earn my Phd to pursue a career in AI research and teaching.
 
While attending Vanderbilt, I was offered a position as a lecturer at a state university. So, I now teach at Tennessee Technological University in the electrical and computer engineering department. There, I lead the capstone program and teach various courses. However, this is a non-tenure track position. Within the next year, I will begin applying for tenure track positions at Tennessee Technological University as well as other institutions. 
 
I aspire to obtain a post-doctoral position at Dartmouth University and then to teach at the University of Tennessee. A postdoc at Dartmouth is attractive for personal reasons and my work in language modeling would be greatly benefitted by expertise there. The University of Tennessee is near to family and has the resources to support my extended future research. Further, it is near the home of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, whom I hope to work with in the computational preservation of the Cherokee language. The notoriety of the Fulbright award would help me achieve these goals.








During the summer of 2022, I spent a week in Ireland at the end of a 2 week journey through Europe. In Ireland I visited Galway, Kinsale, and Dublin primarily. I had the opportunity to stay in historic locations governed by the Irish landmark trust and in individually owned AirBNBs. Relevantly, this lead to a higher level of interaction with hosts than is typical in hotels and forced me to rent a car to get too and from the lodging. This helped to develop my understanding of Irish culture, ability to drive on the left, and awareness of the Irish language. 

The first challenge that will be encountered is difficulty finding lodging due to displaced Ukrainian refugees in Ireland. Second, 

I have successfully conducted engineering projects for customers in Canada, Mexico, Germany, and China. In each of these cases, the first objective is to be a good ambassador for the company in the face of language barriers, cultural differences, and work proclivities, in hopes of getting future projects. During my time in Mexico, I employed Spanish as often as possible to some hilarious ends. However, the benefit was found in the rapport gained by showing interest in the culture and language of others. 

The most significant test of my flexibility was during a 2 week trip to Turks and Caicos my wife and I took a few years ago. While there, hurricane made landfall and we had to abandon our rental home as it was quickly flooding. We forded a river that had formed and made our way to high ground. We wound up stuck in the home of the owner for a few days until the airport could open again.

The first objective is to represent the company well in the face of language barriers, cultural differences, and differing work proclivities, in hopes of getting future projects. During my time in Mexico, I employed Spanish as often as possible to some hilarious ends. However, the benefit was found in the rapport gained by showing interest in the culture and language of others. Additionally, I and my wife acted as host parents to two Japanese exchange students for a year.

The primary challenges that will be encountered is difficulty finding lodging due to displaced Ukrainian refugees in Ireland, and the difference in medical care structures, should the need arise. Lodging will be found by searching early and getting support from the host institution. Obtaining medical care will require patience to accept and understand their system. 






A benefit to conducting a project in Ireland is shared language. Ireland has two official languages, Irish and English. So, while I have spent the last year learning Irish, it is not necessary to communicate with students. Similarly, students taking the course will be computer science students to whom artificial intelligence is inherently relevant.

Based on research conducted by others to evaluate the differences in Irish college students as compared to the United States, Irish students may tend to be reluctant to ask questions and interact in class. This may be challenging as I prefer a teaching approach which moves topics forward through discussion. I will use the first week of lectures to evaluate my approach and adjust as necessary. 

Exchange students returning from Ireland have reported that their modules or courses are often graded based on only a few grade items. So, Irish students may not be familiar with frequent homework assignments. For the courses I may be teaching, I intend to assign roughly 4 projects to be completed across the semester. I will not impose a complex course structure with frequent assignments.

Finally, grading in Ireland is typically conducted on a different scale. An A is considered anything in the range from 70 to 100. If permitted, I intend to grade in a familiar scale for fairness and comparability. However, if this is not acceptable, I intend to grade normally and then develop an appropriate conversion strategy.
