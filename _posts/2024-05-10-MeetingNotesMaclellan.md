## Forgetting Beyond Neural Networks

I was thinking about a previous discussion on forgetting and hit upon a notion. Infinite memory with limited retrieval ability should be indistinguishable from limited memory. So, instance based systems with limited retrieval should exhibit something indistinguishable from forgetting. This would seem to apply both to cobweb and to in-context-learning. 

Show memory-based forgetting and retrieval based forgetting in both the neural and non-neural cases.


## Idea

Good knowledge with appropriate retrieval algorithm with unexpected/non-optimal stopping (possibly from limited resources). Catastrophic retrieval which may be indistinguishable from forgetting. Gives an account of the link between ADHD and risk taking behavior.
